# Optimizing_Magnetic_Coupler_Design


Project Objective :  
   
    the project objective is to study diffrient optimization techniques for designing magnetic coupler.
    
Project Duration :
    
    Spring 2022 ; during my optimization pre-master course in german university in cairo.
    
Project Description :   
    First of all I modeled the system to define the objective function , disicion variable and constrains, the desicion variable was choosen as :
        - Air gap distance.
        - Slip.
        - Num. of magnets.
        - Disk diameter.
At the end we developed the following algorithms :
        - Simulated Annealing (SA) .
        - Genetic Algorithm (GA) .
        - Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).
        - Horas (tailored optimization developed by my own) .
